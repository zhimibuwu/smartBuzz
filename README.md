## This is a course project for Mobile Application and Service. 

### Basic Info:

* Phonegap Framework
* Deployed to both iOS and Android

#### Key pains:

* Freshmen/visitorshavenoideawhethertowalkortakea bus, nor do they know where to switch from one bus line to another
* Sometimes users cannot use existing apps because they do not know what some abbreviations of place stand for
* The existing bus apps do not automatically send users notification in advance whenever they need it; nor do they provide weather information to help users choose their travel mode

#### Solution:

* Provide the travel time/route of both walking and taking bus (bus switching included) to help the user better decide whether to walk or take the bus (what user wants to do)
* Provide real-time navigation (needed by certain users)
* Customized personal calendar and send location-based notification (inform the user what they need)
